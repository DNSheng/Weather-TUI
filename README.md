# Weather TUI - A graphical terminal program to display the weather

This is done as practice for C and learning how to use ncurses. Eventually, it will
encorporate curl or wget to grab weather data from websites.

Todo:

	- Better define the scope of the project
		- Commands
		- Information to be displayed
		- Layout of view

	- Move Makefile outside of src/ folder

	- Start on 'model' of program
		- Begin with faked information (constants)
