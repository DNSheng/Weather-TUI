	- Clean up Makefile, it will eventually get too messy
		- Move Makefile out of src/ folder
		- Create executable out of src/ folder
	- Moved drawing of icons out of draw_main to draw_images
	- Fixed input command handling
		- Now works
	- Now the program draws a solid border
		- Need to make it not interfere with the commands and images
	- 'draw' command makes a gap in the border... Don't know why
	- Consider simplifying the program to only display right now, updating hourly
		- Commands may not be needed?
